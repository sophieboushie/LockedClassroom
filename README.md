This project is a short choose your own adventure horror story, very simple and cliche, built on a single page using HTML, external CSS, and JavaScript. The story changes based on the choices you click without reloading the page.

I’m happy with how the layout turned out and that I was able to upload and link my images correctly. Getting the visuals to match the mood was something I wanted to focus on and it worked the way I expected.

The main challenge for me was JavaScript logic, especially keeping track of when the story should move forward and which buttons should show up at each point. At first the buttons were either not updating or showing at the wrong time.

To solve this, I went back and referenced our class modules and watched a few YouTube videos on if statements and onclick events. Breaking the story into simple steps helped everything make more sense and fixed the issues I was having.
